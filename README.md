# SCIP

This repository is functionally a personal recitation of the Lisp code found in
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Progams* by Alan Perlis. It includes
transcriptions of the code given in the text, as well as solutions (perhaps
refined via the use of other sources) to the various exercises posed in the
book.

Note: I have transcribed the examples in Common Lisp, rather than Scheme.
